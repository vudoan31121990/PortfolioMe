# PortfolioMe

My project is the web application that is design to have my profile and my professional profile with working experiences and projects
The application uses Angular Framework as the front-end code. I use HTML and CSS by my own to build each page inside the application without using any design system framework.
The application has multiple routes in the single page application including Home Page (Vu Doan), About, Resume, Work, Contact.
The application uses the top bar navigation to navigate each route in the application.
The contact web form is submitted to backend service by NodeJs and connect to MongoDB database service.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
