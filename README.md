My project is the web application that is design to have my profile and my professional profile with working experiences and projects
The application uses Angular Framework as the front-end code. I use HTML and CSS by my own to build each page inside the application without using any design system framework.
The application has multiple routes in the single page application including Home Page (Vu Doan), About, Resume, Work, Contact.
The application uses the top bar navigation to navigate each route in the application.
The contact web form is submitted to backend service by NodeJs and connect to MongoDB database service.
